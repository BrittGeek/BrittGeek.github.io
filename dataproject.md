## Projects

### 1. ANN for downscaling Groundwater model - [repo,](https://github.com/BrittGeek/Neural_Network) [poster,](/assets/misc/VIBHOR_FOH (1).pdf) [Visualization](/VISUALIZATION_ANN.html)

This is my key PhD project where I have developed a scheme for downscaling key metrics for Groundwater (GW) Models uisng Remote Sensing (RS) and other modeling data via Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach. Conventionally, Groundwater Storage changes are required to be quantified using Groundwater Monitoring wells on the ground which are not able to measure such chnages on a consistent basis and are expensive to maintain. Satellite Remote Sensing based datasets such as from GRACE satellite provide harmonic coefficients which can be used to compute the Total Water Storage Changes through which Groundwater Storage Changes can be computed through rigorous analysis, althoigh such measurements still suffer from inaccuracies and coarse resolution of ~300 km which hinder accuarate analysis of GW storage chnages at a local level. We use GRACE satellite data along with Precipitation, Temperature, Evapotranspiration and SOil Moisture and other relevant data as input and Storage changes as Label data to improve the GWS estimates from satellite and to create better estimates for future as well. The work has been presented at key conferences   [Presentation for ANN approach in Grounwater Problems](https://www.czech-in.org/cmPortalV15/CM_W3_Searchable/iugg19/normal#!abstractdetails/0000801380).

### 2. Glacier - [Peer Reviewed Papers,]() [Presentations,]() [Repo,]() 

During my undergraduate study, I [led a study](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661316302182) that analyzes and quantifies the mass mass balance for a key Himalayan glacier using a data driven approach. Glaciers are key groundwater resource and many Himalyan glaciers have undergone melting in recent decades. However ground based for monitoring health of such remote Himalayan glacier  are few since these methods are laborious and expensive. Remote Senisng methods often used for studying glacier changes also suffer from  measurements and processing error and lack of ground based validation. We used a holistic data driven approach to understand the different factors affecting the glacier health such as area and velocity chnages and provide a accurate estimate of the glcaier mass balance. The peer reviewed work has been extnsively followed and cited by the scientific community. 

### 3. Computer Vision - [Project files]() Classroom Projects

Used openCV library to work on Classroom projects based on Phottogrammetry, Computer Visison tasks such as Homographic Transformation, Image Mosaicking, etc

### 4.Urban Waste Monitoring and Classification with High Resolution Remote Sesning data - [docs](assets/misc/Study of waste dumping ground in Mumbai1.pdf)

This study focused in using GIS operations in an open sourec softwares and common classification operations such as 

### 5.Hackweek for using Python tools in Geoscience applications - [repo,]() [dashboard,]() [slides]()

### 5. Code sharing in neuroscience - [repo,](https://github.com/srcole/codesharing) [blog](https://srcole.github.io/2018/07/19/code_sharing_journals/)

I scraped the [PubMed API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/) to obtain the full text of around 170,000 articles from 20 different journals that publish neuroscience papers. I did some keyword searching in order to approximately determine which articles relied on custom-written scripts, and which articles publicly shared their code. This involved designing a tool to efficiently, semi-automatically, sift through 200 papers in order to validate the keyword-based estimates. Ultimately, I was able to see how journals vary in terms of code sharing and track how this has improved over time.

This project was expanded during a subsequent hackathon. [Our team improved and expanded the text mining to compute a measure of the openness of each journal ("O-Factor")](https://github.com/srcole/o-factor).





### 8. Politifact fact checks - [repo,](https://github.com/srcole/politifact-analysis) [blog post](https://srcole.github.io/2019/07/20/politifact/)

Politifact is a handy nonprofit organization that rates the truth value of political statements, mostly by American politicians. I scraped the results of their fact checking since their inception in 2007 and visualized some trends across time, geography, and the political spectrum.

### 9. Personal data requests - [repo,](https://github.com/srcole/personal-data-requests) [blog post](https://srcole.github.io/2019/08/17/personal-data-requests/)

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law has prompted many web companies to allow its users to easily download (a subset of) the personal data they have stored. I was curious what information was held by the apps that I use (and what they would provide), so I requested, processed, analyzed, and visualized data from Spotify, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn, Uber, Venmo, Bank of America, and Tinder.

### 13. Interactive visualization - [script,](https://github.com/srcole/qwm/blob/master/retire/make_bokeh.py) [blog](https://srcole.github.io/2017/09/09/retirement/)

I made a simple interactive graph using Bokeh that projects a savings plan to determine when you will have enough money to retire comfortably. I know I'm too young to be thinking about this already.


## Tutorials and teaching

Throughout my time doing these projects, I've also found it useful to make some lectures and tutorials for explaining concepts and tools. Here are some of them!

### 1. Neural signal processing - [Notebooks,](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp/tree/master/tutorials) YouTube videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIK5bfoTnlg)) ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAipVT_B_GY))

In order to help undergrads integrating into the lab, I and other lab members have written tutorials on how to use the standard tools that we use to analyze brain data. This has also included [empirical mode decomposition (EMD)](https://github.com/srcole/binder_emd) and [extracting data from images in a paper](
https://github.com/srcole/qwm/blob/master/misc/paper_data/Extract%20time%20series%20from%20a%20published%20figure.ipynb).



### 3. Introduction to data science - [Clustering slides,](https://srcole.github.io/assets/presentations/cogs108/clustering.html#/) [Linear regression notebook](https://github.com/srcole/qwm/blob/master/misc/COGS108_Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Collinearity.ipynb)

As part of my advisor's introcution to data science undergraduate course, I gave a couple of guest lectures on clustering and multiple linear regression.
